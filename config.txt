# Configuration for MBNB model training


# FULL_TRAIN - Flag to perform full training to after finding optimal n and k values
FULL_TRAIN=true


# PK - Skip ration of rare words. 0.2 means that if they dont exist in at least 20% of the files they will be skipped
PK=0.03
# PN - Skip ration of common words. 3 means that if they exist at least in 300% of the files they will be skipped
PN=0.8

# STARTING_FILES - the percentage of files the first model will be trained on(the least amount of training files to be taken into consideration)
STARTING_FILES=0.19

# MODELS_TO_BE_TRAINED -  the amount of models that will be trained.
MODELS_TO_BE_TRAINED=8

# MODEL_FILES_INCREMENT - the value by which the amount of training files will be incremented in every model.
MODEL_FILES_INCREMENT=0.1

#    example : 
    --starting file = 0.04
    --models_to_be_trained = 10
    --model_files_increment = 0.1f

    --10 models will be trained.
    --the first model will be trained on 4% of the given data
    --the second model will be trained on 14% of the given data
    --the third model will be trained on 24% of the given data, etc


# SAVE_MODELS - Flag to save models after training
SAVE_MODELS=false

# LOAD_MODELS - Flag to load models if available
LOAD_MODELS=false

# LOAD_DIR - Directory to load/save models
LOAD_DIR=data/model

# FILE_CAP - Maximum file processing cap during testing
FILE_CAP=500

# SHED_RATIO - % of entries with highest information gain to be kept
SHED_RATIO = 0.2

# MINIMUM_LETTERS - Minimum number of letters for word inclusion
MINIMUM_LETTERS=3
